If `<versions>` or `<impls>` are not included in the target definition, then it is assumed that ALL versions and implementations are valid for that test target.\n\n# Run tests against specific feature\n\n`<feature>` elements are used to annotate tests in playlist.xml, so that the test can be specially treated based on the JDK feature. There are four options (i.e., applicable, nonapplicable, required and explicit) to choose for one feature. Different features can be enclosed in one `<features>`. The following is an example for AOT feature. For other features, just replace AOT with the feature name defined in TEST_FLAG. \n\n```\n<features>\n           <feature>AOT:applicable</feature> ------ This is the default option. The test will run whether or not TEST_FLAG contains AOT (Special treatment will be applied when TEST_FLAG contains AOT, it will be run multiple times and special JVM option will be applied)\n           <feature>AOT:nonapplicable</feature> ------ The test will NOT run when TEST_FLAG contains AOT\n           <feature>AOT:explicit</feature> ------ The test will run whether or not TEST_FLAG contains AOT (No special treatment will be applied when TEST_FLAG contains AOT, the test will run as-is) Currently, this option is only meaningful for AOT.\n           <feature>AOT:required</feature> ------ the test will run ONLY when TEST_FLAG contains AOT (Special treatment will be applied)\n</features>\n```\n\n# Rerun the failed tests from the last run\n```\n    make _failed\n```\n\n# With a different set of JVM options\nThere are 3 ways to add options to your test run:\n\n- If you simply want to add an option for a one-time run, you can either override the original options by using JVM_OPTIONS=\"your options\".\n\n- If you want to append options to the set that are already there, use EXTRA_OPTIONS=\"your extra options\". Below example will append to those options already in the make target.\n```\n    make _jsr292_InDynTest_SE90_0 EXTRA_OPTIONS=-Xint\n```\n\n- When appending `Xjit` option with braces, you'll need to either enclose them in quotes or escape them. Quotes won't work for tests which use STF framework, ex: system tests, so you'll need to escape them. This is because STF processes the options before forwarding them to the test JVM and it won't forward anything that it doesn't understand. Below is an example of what will be forwarded.\n```\n-Xjit:\\{java/lang/reflect/Method.get*\\}\\(traceFull,log=tracelog.log\\)\n```\n- If you want to change test options, you can update playlist.xml in the corresponding test project.\n\n# Run test or group of tests multiple times\n- Using TEST_ITERATIONS to specify the number of iterations. The test (for group target, each test in the group) will be executed multiple times. The test will pass if all the iterations pass. This feature is designed to repetitively run small test targets, use with caution for top-level test targets that may take a long time to run.\n\n```\n    make _testExample TEST_ITERATIONS=2\n```\nor\n```\n    export TEST_ITERATIONS=2\n    make _testExample\n```"

    "question": "How to exclude tests in OpenJ9 test?",
    "answer": "# Automatically exclude a test target\nInstead of having to manually create a PR to disable test targets, they can now be automatically disabled via Github workflow (see autoTestPR.yml).

If the testName is testCaseName followed by _n, only the (n+1)th variation will be excluded.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n<test>\n  <testCaseName>jdk_test</testCaseName>\n  <variations>\n    <variation>NoOptions</variation>\n    <variation>-Xmx1024m</variation>\n  </variations>\n  ...\n```\nTo exclude the entire suite:\n\n```auto exclude test jdk_test```\n\nTo exclude the 2nd variation listed which is assigned suffix_1 ```-Xmx1024m```:\n\n```auto exclude test jdk_test_1```\n\nTo exclude the test for openj9 only:\n\n```auto exclude test jdk_test impl=openj9```\n\nTo exclude the test for adoptopenjdk vendor only:\n\n```auto exclude test jdk_test vendor=adoptopenjdk```\n\nTo exclude the test for java 8 only:\n\n```auto exclude test jdk_test ver=8```\n\nTo exclude the test for all linux platforms:\n\n```auto exclude test jdk_test plat=.*linux.*```\n\nplat is defined in regular expression.

The PR will be linked to issue. If the testName can not be found in the repo, no PR will be created and there will be a comment left in the issue linking to the failed workflow run for more details. In the case where the parameter contains space separated values, use single quotes to group the parameter.\n\n# Manually exclude a test target\nSearch the test name to find its playlist.xml file. Add a ```<disables>``` element after ```<testCaseName>``` element. The ```<disables>``` element is used to capsulate all ```<disable>``` elements. ```<disable>``` should always contain a ```<comment>``` element to specify the related issue url (or issue comment url).\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n<test>\n  <testCaseName>jdk_test</testCaseName>\n  <disables>\n    <disable>\n      <comment>https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/123456</comment>\n    <disable>\n  </disables>\n  ...\n```\n\nThis will disable the entire test suite. The following section describes how to disable the specific test cases.\n\n## Exclude a specific test variation:\nAdd a ```<variation>``` element in the ```<disable>``` element to specify the variation. The ```<variation>``` element must match an element defined in the ```<variations>``` element.\n\nFor example, to exclude the test case with variation ```-Xmx1024m```:\n\n```\n<test>\n  <testCaseName>jdk_test</testCaseName>\n  <disables>\n    <disable>\n      <comment>https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/123456</comment>\n      <variation>-Xmx1024m</variation>\n    </disable>\n  </disables>\n  ...\n  <variations>\n    <variation>NoOptions</variation>\n    <variation>-Xmx1024m</variation>\n  </variations>\n  ...\n```\n\n## Exclude a test against specific java implementation:\nAdd a ```<impl>``` element in the ```<disable>``` element to specify the implementation.\n\nFor example, to exclude the test for openj9 only:\n\n```\n<test>\n  <testCaseName>jdk_test</testCaseName>\n  <disables>\n    <disable>\n      <comment>https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/123456</comment>\n      <impl>openj9</impl>\n    </disable>\n  </disables>\n  ...\n```\n\n## Exclude a test against specific java vendor:\nAdd a ```<vendor>``` element in the ```<disable>``` element to specify the vendor information.\n\nFor example, to exclude the test for AdoptOpenJDK only:\n\n```\n<test>\n  <testCaseName>jdk_test</testCaseName>\n  <disables>\n    <disable>\n      <comment>https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/123456</comment>\n      <vendor>adoptopenjdk</vendor>\n    </disable>\n  </disables>\n\n  ...\n```\n\n## Exclude a test against specific java version:\nAdd a ```<version>``` element in the ```<disable>``` element to specify the version.\n\nFor example, to exclude the test for java 11 and up:\n\n```\n<test>\n  <testCaseName>jdk_test</testCaseName>\n  <disables>\n    <disable>\n      <comment>https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/123456</comment>\n      <version>11+</version>\n   </disable>\n  </disables>\n  ...\n```\n\n\n## Exclude a test against specific platform:\nAdd a ```<platform>``` element in the ```<disable>``` element to specify the platform in regular expression. All platforms can be found here: https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/blob/master/buildenv/jenkins/openjdk_tests\n\nFor example, to exclude the test for all linux platforms:\n\n```\n<test>\n  <testCaseName>jdk_test</testCaseName>\n  <disables>\n    <disable>\n      <comment>https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/123456</comment>\n      <platform>.*linux.*</plat>\n    </disable>\n  </disables>\n  ...\n```\n\n\n## Exclude test against multiple criteria:\nDefined a combination of ```<variation>```, ```<impl>```, ```<version>```, and  ```<platform>``` in the ```<disable>``` element.\n\nFor example, to exclude the test with variation ```-Xmx1024m``` against adoptopenjdk openj9 java 8 on windows only:\n\n```\n<test>\n  <testCaseName>jdk_test</testCaseName>\n  <disables>\n    <disable>\n      <comment>https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/123456</comment>\n      <variation>-Xmx1024m</variation>\n      <version>8</version>\n      <impl>openj9</impl>\n      <vendor>adoptopenjdk</vendor>\n      <platform>.*windows.*</platform>\n    </disable>\n  </disables>\n  ...\n```\n\nNote: Same element cannot be defined multiple times inside one ```<disable>``` element. It is because the elements inside the disable element are in AND relationship.\n\nFor example, to exclude test on against hotspot and openj9. It is required to define multiple ```<disable>``` elements, each with a single ```<impl>``` element inside:\n\n```\n<test>\n  <testCaseName>jdk_test</testCaseName>\n  <disables>\n    <disable>\n      <comment>https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/123456</comment>\n      <version>8</version>\n      <impl>openj9</impl>\n    </disable>\n    <disable>\n      <comment>https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/123456</comment>\n      <version>8</version>\n      <impl>hotspot</impl>\n    </disable>\n  </disables>\n  ...\n```\n\nOr remove ```<impl>``` element to exclude test against all implementations:\n\n```\n<test>\n  <testCaseName>jdk_test</testCaseName>\n  <disables>\n    <disable>\n      <comment>https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/123456</comment>\n      <version>8</version>\n    </disable>\n  </disables>\n  ...\n```\n# Execute excluded test target\n\nIf a test is disabled using `<disable>` tag in playlist.xml, it can be executed by specifying the test target or adding `disabled` in front of its top-level test target.\n\n```\n        make _disabled.testA    // testA has <disabled> tag in playlist.xml\n        make _disabled.sanity.functional\n        make _disabled.extended\n```\n\nDisabled tests and reasons can also be printed through adding `echo.disabled` in front of regular target.\n\n```\n        make _echo.disabled.testA\n        make _echo.disabled.sanity.functional\n        make _echo.disabled.extended\n```\n\n\n# more granular exclusion for testNG test\n## Exclude temporarily on all platforms\nDepends on the JDK_VERSION, add a line in the test/TestConfig/resources/excludes/latest_exclude_$(JDK_VERSION).txt file. It is the same format that the OpenJDK tests use, name of test, defect number, platforms to exclude.\n\nTo exclude on all platforms, use generic-all.  For example:\n```\n    org.openj9.test.java.lang.management.TestOperatingSystemMXBean:testGetProcessCPULoad 121187 generic-all\n```\n\nNote that we additionally added support to exclude individual methods of a\ntest class, by using :methodName behind the class name (OpenJDK does not\nsupport this currently). In the example, only the testGetProcessCPULoad\nmethod from that class will be excluded (on all platforms/specs).\n\n## Exclude temporarily on specific platforms or architectures\nSame as excluding on all platforms, you add a line to\nlatest_exclude_$(JDK_VERSION).txt file, but with specific specs to\nexclude, for example:\n\n```\n    org.openj9.test.java.lang.management.TestOperatingSystemMXBean 121187 linux_x86-64\n```\n\nThis example would exclude all test methods of the TestOperatingSystemMXBean\nfrom running on the linux_x86-64 platform.\nNote: in OpenJ9 the defect numbers would associate with git issue numbers\n(OpenJDK defect numbers associate with their bug tracking system).\n\n## Exclude permanently on all or specific platforms/archs\n\nFor tests that should NEVER run on particular platforms or\narchitectures, we should not use the default_exclude.txt file. To\ndisable those tests, we annotate the test class to be disabled. To\nexclude MyTest from running on the aix platform, for example:\n```\n    @Test(groups={ \"level.sanity\", \"component.jit\", \"disabled.os.aix\" })\n        public class MyTest {\n        ...\n```\n\nWe currently support the following exclusion groups:\n```\ndisabled.os.<os> (e.g. disabled.os.aix)\ndisabled.arch.<arch> (e.g. disabled.arch.ppc)\ndisabled.bits.<bits> (e.g. disabled.bits.64)\ndisabled.spec.<spec> (e.g. disabled.spec.linux_x86-64)\n```"

    "question": "How to view results in OpenJ9 test?",
    "answer": "# Results in the console\nOpenJ9 tests written in testNG format take advantage of the testNG logger.\n\nIf you want your test to print output, you are required to use the\ntestng logger (and not System.out.print statements). In this way,\nwe can not only direct that output to console, but also to various\nother clients (WIP).  At the end of a test run, the results are\nsummarized to show which tests are passed / failed / disabled / skipped.  This gives\nyou a quick view of the test names and numbers in each category\n(passed/failed/disabled/skipped).  If you've piped the output to a file, or\nif you like scrolling up, you can search for and find the specific\noutput of the tests that failed (exceptions or any other logging\nthat the test produces).\n\n- `SKIPPED` tests\n\nIf a test is skipped, it means that this test cannot be run on this\nplatform due to jvm options, platform requirements and/or test\ncapabilities.\n\n- `DISABLED` tests\n\nIf a test is disabled, it means that this test is disabled using `<disable>` tag in playlist.xml.\n\n# Results in html files\n\nTestNG tests produce html (and xml) output from the tests are\ncreated and stored in a test_output_xxxtimestamp folder in the\nTKG directory (or from where you ran \"make test\").\n\nThe output is organized by tests, each test having its own set of\noutput.  If you open the index.html file in a web browser, you will\nbe able to see which tests passed, failed or were skipped, along\nwith other information like execution time and error messages,\nexceptions and logs from the individual test methods.\n\n# TAP result files\n\nAs some of the tests are not testNG or junit format, a simple standardized format for test output was needed so that all tests are reported in the same way for a complete test summary. Depending on the requirement there are three different diagnostic levels.\n\n\t\t* export DIAGNOSTICLEVEL=failure\n\t\t\tDefault level. Log all detailed failure information if test fails\n\t\t* export DIAGNOSTICLEVEL=all\n\t\t\tLog all detailed information no matter test failures or succeed\n\t\t* export DIAGNOSTICLEVEL=nodetails\n\t\t\tNo need to log any detailed information.

    "question": "How to reproduce test failures in OpenJ9?",
    "answer": "A common scenario is that automated testing finds a failure and a developer is asked to reproduce it.  An openj9 issue is created reporting a failing test.  The issue should contain:\n* link(s) to Jenkins job (which contains all of the info you need, if you get to it before the Jenkins job is deleted, which is quickly to save space on Jenkins master)\n* test target name (TARGET)\n* test group / test directory name (one of the following, functional, system, openjdk, external, perf) (BUILD_LIST)\n* test level (one of the following, sanity, extended, special)\n* platform(s) the test fails on (Jenkinsfile)\n* version the test fails in (JDK_VERSION)\n* implementation the test fails against (JDK_IMPL)\n* SDK build that was used by the test (in the console output of the Jenkins job, there is java -version info and a link to the SDK used)\n\nA specific example, [Issue 6555](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/issues/6555) Test_openjdk13_j9_sanity.system_ppc64le_linux TestIBMJlmRemoteMemoryAuth_0 crash\nwe get the following info (captured in the name of the issue):\n* TARGET = TestIBMJlmRemoteMemoryAuth_0\n* BUILD_LIST = system\n* JDK_VERSION = 13\n* JDK_IMPL = openj9 (its implied if the failure was found in openj9 testing at OpenJ9's Jenkins)\n* Jenkinsfile = openjdk_ppc64le_linux (corresponds to platform to run on)\n\nSince only a link to the Jenkins job was provided in the example issue 6555, we do not have java -version info, we will have to go to the job link to find out the exact SDK build, though it may be sufficient just to rerun the test with the latest nightly build to reproduce.  Given those pieces of information, we have enough to try and rerun this test, either in a Grinder job in Jenkins, or locally on a machine (on the same platform as the test failure)."
