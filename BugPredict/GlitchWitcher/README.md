# REPD: Defect Prediction

A machine learning system that predicts software defect likelihood using reconstruction error analysis with autoencoders and statistical distribution fitting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project implements a novel approach to software defect prediction that combines:

- **Autoencoder neural networks** for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction
- **Reconstruction error analysis** to identify anomalous code patterns
- **Statistical distribution fitting** to model defect vs. non-defect characteristics
- **Automated CI/CD integration** via GitHub Actions for real-time code quality assessment in [OpenJ9](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9)

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Automated defect prediction** on pull requests
- **Traditional software metrics extraction** (complexity, lines of code, etc.)
- **Deep learning-based feature transformation** using autoencoders
- **Probabilistic defect analysis** using Probability Density Functions (PDFs)
- **Pre-trained model support** for fast predictions
- **GitHub Actions integration** for seamless CI/CD workflows

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract traditional software metrics from source code.
2. **Model Training**: Train an autoencoder on a large corpus of non-defective code.
3. **Error Analysis**: Calculate the model's reconstruction error for new code. A higher error suggests the code is anomalous.
4. **Distribution Fitting**: Model the reconstruction error distributions for both historically defective and non-defective code.
5. **Prediction**: For new code changes, calculate the PDF value against both distributions to determine which category is a better fit.

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Autoencoder**: [20, 17, 7] hidden layer configuration
- **Training**: 500 epochs, learning rate 0.001, batch size 128
- **Distributions**: Automatic best-fit selection (e.g., Log-Normal, Pareto) for error distributions.
- **Error Function**: L2 norm reconstruction error

### Supported File Types

- C/C++ source files (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.cc`, `.h`, `.hpp`, `.hxx`)

## ðŸ“Š Example Output

#### File: `example.cpp`

Outcome: Defective -> Non-Defective

| Metric                                     | BEFORE PR   | AFTER PR    | % Change |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| PDF(Defective \| Reconstruction Error)     | 2.51234e-08 | 1.12345e-08 | -55.23%  |
| PDF(Non-Defective \| Reconstruction Error) | 8.94561e-09 | 7.65432e-08 | +755.44% |

#### File: `utils.cpp`

Outcome: Non-Defective -> Non-Defective

| Metric                                     | BEFORE PR   | AFTER PR    | % Change |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| PDF(Defective \| Reconstruction Error)     | 5.67890e-09 | 4.23456e-09 | -25.43%  |
| PDF(Non-Defective \| Reconstruction Error) | 3.21098e-08 | 3.87654e-08 | +20.73%  |

### ðŸ“‹ Interpretation Note:

> The values shown are Probability Densities (PDFs), not probabilities. They represent the model's assessment of how likely a file's characteristics are to be 'defective' vs. 'non-defective'. A higher value indicates a better fit for that category. Very small values are expected and normal.
